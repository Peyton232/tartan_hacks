# Moti the Motivational Robot

A mobile application that helps you keep all your plans, events, and reminders in one place. It also connects to a live databse on firebase which allows our app to ocnnect to a python AI on a remote server which will take user responses and then act as a personal assistant to help motivate and remind the user to do their tasks, as well as scheduale different tasks for you.

## How to Run

Make sure you have the fllutter SDK installed and an IDE like android studio or VScode

run
flutter pub get
flutter clean
flutter run

the python script must be live on the remote server, otherwise no response will eb sent back to the user.
